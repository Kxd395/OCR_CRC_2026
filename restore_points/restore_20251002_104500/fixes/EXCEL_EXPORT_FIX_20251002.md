# Excel Export Issue - RESOLVED ✅

**Issue**: Excel file was not in the run directory  
**Root Cause**: Pipeline created Excel in `exports/` but didn't copy it to run artifacts  
**Resolution**: Added automatic copy step + manually copied for current run

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Modified Pipeline ✅
Updated `run_pipeline.py` to automatically copy the Excel file into each run's directory:

```python
# Copy Excel file into run directory for archival
run_export_path = run_dir / "export" / export_path.name
run_export_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
if export_path.exists():
    shutil.copy2(export_path, run_export_path)
```

### 2. Copied Current Run's Excel File ✅
Manually copied the Excel file for `run_20251002_103645`:
```bash
cp exports/run_20251002_103645.xlsx artifacts/run_20251002_103645/export/
```

### 3. Updated Documentation ✅
Updated `INDEX.md` to reflect the Excel file location:
- Changed "Export: Pending" → "Excel Export: export/run_20251002_103645.xlsx ✅"

## Excel File Locations

Your Excel export is now available in **two places**:

1. **Archived in Run Directory** (recommended for reference):
   ```
   artifacts/run_20251002_103645/export/run_20251002_103645.xlsx
   ```
   - Part of the complete run artifacts
   - Preserved with all other run data
   - Self-contained for archival

2. **Working Copy** (for quick access):
   ```
   exports/run_20251002_103645.xlsx
   ```
   - Easily accessible from project root
   - Can be opened/modified without affecting archived version

---

## Opening the Excel File

### Option 1: From Run Directory (Recommended)
```bash
open artifacts/run_20251002_103645/export/run_20251002_103645.xlsx
```

### Option 2: From Exports Directory
```bash
open exports/run_20251002_103645.xlsx
```

Both files are identical - use whichever is more convenient!

## What the Excel File Contains

Based on the export script output:

**4 Worksheets**:
1. **Summary** - Overview statistics
2. **Detailed** - All checkbox results by page
3. **Response Tally** - Answer distribution across questions
4. **Raw Data** - For pivot tables and further analysis

**Data**:
- 26 pages processed
- 128 total marked checkboxes
- 25 checkbox positions per page (Q1_1 through Q5_5)
- Fill percentage for each checkbox
- Marked/unmarked status

## Future Runs

✅ **All future runs will automatically include the Excel file in the run directory!**

The pipeline now:
1. Creates Excel file in `exports/<run_id>.xlsx`
2. Copies it to `artifacts/<run_id>/export/<run_id>.xlsx`
3. Updates the manifest with export location
4. Prints confirmation message

---

## Verification

To verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check the file exists
ls -lh artifacts/run_20251002_103645/export/

# Check INDEX.md references it
grep -A 2 "Results" artifacts/run_20251002_103645/INDEX.md

# Open the file
open artifacts/run_20251002_103645/export/run_20251002_103645.xlsx
```

---

**Fixed**: October 2, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - Excel file now in run directory and pipeline updated for future runs
