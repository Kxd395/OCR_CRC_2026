# Pipeline Status Report - October 2, 2025

## Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Complete

### ✅ Successfully Completed

1. **Documentation Organization**
   - ✅ Created comprehensive documentation index (`docs/INDEX.md`)
   - ✅ Created folder structure guide (`docs/FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md`)
   - ✅ Created anchor calibration guide (`docs/ANCHOR_CALIBRATION.md`)
   - ✅ Created project status document (`docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`)
   - ✅ Updated all cross-references

2. **Folder Naming Convention**
   - ✅ Updated scripts to use sequential naming:
     - `step0_images/` - PDF ingestion output
     - `step1_anchor_detection/` - Anchor detection results
     - `step2_alignment_and_crop/` - Aligned and cropped pages
     - `step3_overlays/` - Checkbox overlays (planned)
     - `step4_ocr_results/` - OCR results (planned)
     - `step5_qa_overlays/` - QA overlays (planned)

3. **Anchor Detection Calibration**
   - ✅ 100% detection rate validated (104/104 anchors)
   - ✅ Top anchors: Y=0.0706 (search box 100-260px)
   - ✅ Bottom anchors: Y=0.9431 (search box 2325-2485px)
   - ✅ Tested across 26-page survey

4. **Pipeline Steps 0-2**
   - ✅ **Step 0 (PDF Ingestion)**: Working perfectly
     - Extracts 26 pages
     - Saves to `step0_images/`
   
   - ✅ **Step 1 (Anchor Detection)**: Working perfectly
     - 100% detection rate
     - Saves to `step1_anchor_detection/`
     - Creates visualizations
   
   - ✅ **Step 2 (Alignment & Cropping)**: Working perfectly
     - All 26 pages aligned
     - Perfect 0.00px mean error
     - Saves to `step2_alignment_and_crop/`
     - Creates both `aligned_full/` and `aligned_cropped/`

### ❌ Issues Identified

1. **Script Compatibility Issues**
   - Scripts expect different file locations/names
   - `make_overlays.py` expects `logs/homography.json` but `step2_align_and_crop.py` creates `step2_alignment_and_crop/alignment_results.json`
   - Scripts use different folder naming conventions internally
   - Import issues when running scripts with `.venv/bin/python` vs `python3`

2. **Pipeline Automation**
   - Pipeline stops after step 2
   - Steps 3-8 not executing
   - `capture_env()` function can hang on `platform.platform()`
   - Scripts fail silently without proper error reporting

3. **Module Import Problems**
   - Scripts import `from scripts.common import ...`
   - Works with PYTHONPATH set correctly
   - Doesn't work when run directly with venv python
   - Pipeline sets PYTHONPATH but scripts still fail

### 🎯 What Works Right Now

**Successful Run: `artifacts/run_20251002_075331/`**

```
run_20251002_075331/
├── step0_images/           ✅ 26 pages (1650×2550px)
├── step1_anchor_detection/ ✅ 104/104 anchors detected
│   ├── anchor_detection_log.json
│   └── visualizations/     ✅ 26 visual confirmations
└── step2_alignment_and_crop/ ✅ 26 pages aligned perfectly
    ├── aligned_full/       ✅ 26 full pages (2550×3300px)
    ├── aligned_cropped/    ✅ 26 cropped pages (2267×2954px)
    ├── alignment_results.json
    └── visualizations/     ✅ 26 alignment visualizations
```

**Validation:**
- Anchor detection: 100% (104/104)
- Alignment quality: Perfect (0.00px error on all pages)
- Folder structure: Correct sequential naming

### 📋 Remaining Work

#### High Priority

1. **Fix Script Compatibility**
   - Update `make_overlays.py` to read from `step2_alignment_and_crop/alignment_results.json`
   - Update `run_ocr.py` to read from correct locations
   - Update `qa_overlay_from_results.py` to read from correct locations
   - Ensure all scripts use same folder structure

2. **Fix Pipeline Automation**
   - Make `capture_env()` more robust (already added try/except, needs testing)
   - Add better error reporting between steps
   - Ensure pipeline doesn't fail silently
   - Add step completion validation

3. **Complete Steps 3-8**
   - Step 3: check_alignment (optional, informational)
   - Step 4: make_overlays (checkbox visualization)
   - Step 5: run_ocr (checkbox detection)
   - Step 6: qa_overlay_from_results (QA visualizations)
   - Step 7: validate_run (validation checks)
   - Step 8: export_to_excel (final report)

#### Medium Priority

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - Run complete pipeline end-to-end
   - Verify Excel export generates correctly
   - Test with different PDF inputs
   - Validate threshold settings

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Document known issues
   - Add troubleshooting for common errors
   - Update pipeline automation guide with current status

### 🔧 Immediate Next Steps

**Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)**
1. Update the 3 scripts that need alignment data to read from `step2_alignment_and_crop/alignment_results.json`
2. Test each step individually with PYTHONPATH set
3. Run complete pipeline

**Option 2: Manual Completion**
1. Use the successful run_20251002_075331
2. Manually run steps 4-8 with proper environment
3. Document the manual process
4. Fix automation later

**Option 3: Start Fresh**
1. Create new simplified scripts that match the folder structure
2. Ensure compatibility from the start
3. Test incrementally

### 📊 Success Metrics

**Currently Achieved:**
- ✅ 100% anchor detection
- ✅ 100% alignment success  
- ✅ Correct folder structure
- ✅ Complete documentation

**Still Needed:**
- ❌ Full pipeline automation
- ❌ OCR step completion
- ❌ Excel export generation
- ❌ End-to-end validation

### 💡 Key Insights

1. **Anchor calibration is solid** - 100% detection is excellent
2. **Alignment works perfectly** - 0.00px error is ideal
3. **Folder structure is good** - Sequential naming makes sense
4. **Scripts need synchronization** - Different expectations causing failures

### 🎯 Recommendation

**Focus on fixing the 3-4 scripts** that need to work together:
- `make_overlays.py`
- `run_ocr.py`
- `qa_overlay_from_results.py`
- `export_to_excel.py`

These scripts need to:
1. Read from the new folder structure
2. Write to the new folder structure
3. Work with the alignment data format from step2

Once these are fixed, the pipeline will complete successfully.
